# ComfyUI-H3-FaceRefine

**A ComfyUI custom node set to refine and improve the quality of small faces in MiniMax H3 video.**

MiniMax H3 renders faces poorly when the head occupies a small fraction of the frame. This is a property
of head-size-in-frame, not of output resolution, so it persists at 720p and above. These nodes
detect the face on every frame, crop to it so it fills a canvas, let H3 re-generate it, and
composite the result back into the original video.

Modelled on [Impact Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)'s **FaceDetailer**,
adapted from stills to video.

## Results

Source on the left, refined on the right:

![source vs refined, side by side](screenshots/COMPARISON.gif)

Single frame at full resolution:

| Source | Refined |
|---|---|
| ![source frame](screenshots/INPUT_00001.png) | ![refined frame](screenshots/REFINED_00001.png) |

The reason it works is what H3 is handed. Instead of a distant head a few dozen pixels tall, it
gets the face tracked and normalized to fill the canvas:

| Crop in: what H3 sees | Crop out: what H3 returns |
|---|---|
| ![input crop](screenshots/CROPS_INPUT_00001.gif) | ![refined crop](screenshots/CROPS_00001.gif) |
| [full-res still](screenshots/CROPS_INPUT_00001.png) | [full-res still](screenshots/CROPS_00001.png) |

These two are what to watch for temporal behaviour: the box has to sit still on a moving subject,
or the refined face boils.

## What's new in 1.1.2

**[H3 Face Track + Crop](#h3-face-track--crop) no longer jumps to another person when it loses the
subject.** When the subject's face stopped being detected - a head turned away, a spin, a face
covered - while anyone else was in shot, the tracker moved onto the nearest other face and stayed
there, and the report still counted every frame as found. It now only carries the subject onto a
face within reach of where they just were. Frames with no such face are left unresolved: the crop is
interpolated across them and the composite fades out, so they keep their original pixels. The
subject is picked up again when their face reappears near where it was lost. Frames before a shot's
lock-on are filled back under the same rule, and shots that never hold more than one face track
exactly as before. See [When the subject is lost](#choosing-which-face).

**The report says when the subject was lost.** A new `lost:` line counts those frames and lists
their ranges, and `face=` and `dropout runs` include them, instead of reporting every frame as found.
In `preview` those frames are drawn red - see [Reading `preview`](#h3-face-track--crop).

**`fallback_detector` uses the body nearest where the subject's head should be**, rather than the
largest body in frame.

Nothing needs rewiring, and saved workflows load unchanged.

## What's new in 1.1.0

**[H3 Load Video + Face Select](#h3-load-video--face-select) is new.** It loads the video, finds
every face and every hard cut in one pass, and settles which face is the subject *before* the graph
runs, so the tracker never detects the same video twice. It brings two interactive surfaces with it:
[Pick faces](#pick-faces), for choosing the subject per shot by eye, and
[Preview coordinates](#preview-coordinates), for checking where an `X`, `Y` lands.

**That node adds one dependency: [PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect)**
(`scenedetect>=0.7`), which installs automatically with the pack. It backs
`cut_detection = auto (pyscenedetect)` on both the new node and `H3 Face Track + Crop`, finding
the **hard cuts** in a clip. Cuts matter because a cut renumbers every face and breaks continuity:
with them known, the subject is chosen once per shot and the smoothing, interpolation and
composite fade all run per shot instead of being dragged across the join. It is fed frame by frame
from the decode pass that is already running, so it costs no second decode of the video.
`cut_threshold` is PySceneDetect's own adaptive default of `3.0`.

It is a soft dependency in practice: if it is missing or fails to import, the run does not stop.
The video is treated as a single shot and the report says so — `cut detection unavailable,
treating the video as one shot`.

**[H3 Per-Frame Denoise](#h3-per-frame-denoise) now takes and returns `MODEL`.** A per-frame mask
needs two changes to the model rather than the latent, so the node must sit in the model path and
its `model` output has to reach the guider. Its two strength widgets were renamed
`denoise_multiplier_small_face` and `denoise_multiplier_large_face`, which is what they always were.

> **This breaks workflows saved against 1.0.0.** `model` is a *required* input, so an old graph fails validation with `Required input is missing: model` until you route the model through the node and take its `model` output onward to the guider. Nothing else in this release requires rewiring.

**[H3 Face Track + Crop](#h3-face-track--crop) gained** a `frame_count` output to wire into the H3
node's `length`, a `face_pick` input for the node above, `absent_shots` for skipping shots the
subject is not in, `identity_model` for choosing how faces are compared, cut detection, and the
expanded `select` list below.

**`select` went from two modes to nine.** 1.0 offered `largest` and `most_central`; there are now
`largest_face`, `smallest_face`, `left_most`, `right_most`, `top_most`, `bottom_most`, `centre_most`,
`closest_to_xy` and `detector_score`, with direction in the name rather than a separate order widget.
Saved workflows migrate on load: `largest` becomes `largest_face`, `most_central` becomes
`centre_most`.

**`canvas_width` / `canvas_height` now default to `768`**, H3's native short edge, rather than `512`.

**The auto canvas modes now clamp up to a minimum of 512×512.** They size the canvas from the
largest crop, and the crop is bounded by the source frame, so on a small face in a low-resolution
clip the canvas used to track the crop down to a couple of hundred pixels — handing H3 the same
small face it renders badly. `manual` is unaffected and still takes whatever you type.

## Installation

Clone into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Carasibana/ComfyUI-H3-FaceRefine.git
```

Restart ComfyUI. The nodes appear under **MiniMax H3/Face Refine**.

### Requirements

**For the nodes themselves:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ComfyUI with MiniMax H3 support | H3's own nodes are **core** (`comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py`), not an add-on, you just need a build recent enough to have them |
| a face detector | e.g. `face_yolov8m.pt` in `models/ultralytics/bbox/`. The one thing you must supply yourself. For anime, use an anime face model instead. The **nodes** find it there on their own; the **example workflows** additionally need the folder registration described below, because their stored detector values carry its `bbox\` prefix |

Python packages (`ultralytics`, `scipy`, `insightface`, `scenedetect`) install automatically
from `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`. `scenedetect` is PySceneDetect, used only by
`cut_detection`; without it cut detection is skipped and the clip is treated as one shot.

> **A note on onnxruntime.** `insightface` needs it, and this pack deliberately does not pin
> a variant. If you install `onnxruntime-gpu` *alongside* an existing `onnxruntime`, the
> CPU-only package shadows it, `CUDAExecutionProvider` disappears, and identity matching
> silently runs on CPU. Install one or the other, not both. Check with:
> `python -c "import onnxruntime; print(onnxruntime.get_available_providers())"`

**Additionally, to run the example workflows.** The first three are needed to queue either template
as shipped; the last two back a node pair that ships **muted**:

| | |
|---|---|
| [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite) | **Both templates**, for the save (`VHS_VideoCombine`). **Auto Select** also loads the source with it (`VHS_LoadVideoPath`); **Manual Select** loads video with this pack's own `H3 Load Video + Face Select` instead, so it needs VideoHelperSuite only to save |
| [ComfyUI-H3-NativeAudioLock](https://github.com/Shrek3OnVH5/MiniMax-H3-NativeAudio-MusicVideo-Workflow) | **Both templates.** Supplies `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock`, which drives lipsync. It ships inside that repository under `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-H3-NativeAudioLock`, so copy that folder into your own `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` |
| [ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) | **Both templates.** Its subpack registers the `ultralytics_bbox` / `ultralytics` model folders, and the templates' detector values are stored in that registration's naming — `bbox\face_yolov8m.pt` and `segm\person_yolov8m-seg.pt`. Without it those values are not in the dropdown and the prompt fails validation on load. It also supplies `SAMLoader` if you unmute the SAM mask pair |
| [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) | only if you unmute the GGUF loader pair. Both workflows ship it muted in favour of the stock loaders |
| a SAM model in `models/sams/` | only if you unmute the SAM mask pair, alongside Impact Pack above |

Model lookups go through ComfyUI's `folder_paths`, so anything registered in
`extra_model_paths.yaml` is found automatically.

### Models

| Model | Goes in | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `face_yolov8m.pt` | `models/ultralytics/bbox/` | [Bingsu/adetailer](https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer/blob/main/face_yolov8m.pt) |
| `person_yolov8m-seg.pt` *(optional for the nodes, but both templates ship it wired as `fallback_detector`)* | `models/ultralytics/segm/` | [Bingsu/adetailer](https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer/blob/main/person_yolov8m-seg.pt) |
| an anime face detector *(optional, anime and other illustration)* | `models/ultralytics/bbox/` | [deepghs/anime_face_detection](https://huggingface.co/deepghs/anime_face_detection), or Anzhc's face-seg models. `face_yolov8m.pt` may not find anime faces — see [Anime and other non-photographic material](#anime-and-other-non-photographic-material) |
| a CLIP Vision model *(optional, only for `identity_model = clip_vision`)* | `models/clip_vision/` | any CLIP Vision model, wired through a `CLIPVisionLoader`. You probably already have one for IPAdapter or Redux |
| MiniMax H3 diffusion model | `models/diffusion_models/` | [Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3) |
| Qwen3-VL text encoder | `models/text_encoders/` | [Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3) |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` | `models/vae/` | [Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3/tree/main/vae) |
| `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors` | `models/vae/` | [Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3/tree/main/vae) |
| a turbo LoRA *(optional, big speed-up)* | `models/loras/` | [Kijai/MiniMax-H3_comfy](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/MiniMax-H3_comfy/tree/main/loras), distilled by [lightx2v](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo). The example workflows ship the **8-step v1.0** at strength `1.0`, with `BasicScheduler` set to 8 steps to match — the step count must follow whichever turbo LoRA you load |
| `sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth` *(optional, only if you unmute the SAM mask pair)* | `models/sams/` | [Meta segment-anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#model-checkpoints) |
| InsightFace `buffalo_l` *(optional, crowd tracking on photographed faces)* | `models/insightface/` | downloaded automatically on first use. Backs `identity_model = insightface`; on illustration use `clip_vision` or `ccip` instead |

H3's original weights are [MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3); the
Comfy-Org repository above is the repackaged form ComfyUI expects. The example workflows load the
model and text encoder through the stock `UNETLoader` and `CLIPLoader`. Their stored values name the
specific quantisations the examples were built against, so unless you happen to have those exact
files you will need to re-pick both loaders after opening a template. A **GGUF** pair
([ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF)) sits beside them, muted, with a note:
unmute it and mute the stock pair to fit H3 in 12 GB.

Only the face detector is genuinely required by the nodes themselves. Everything else is needed
because the pipeline runs H3, so if you are already generating H3 video you will have it already.

---

### Reading videos from outside ComfyUI

`H3 Load Video + Face Select` takes a path to any video on your machine, because source footage
usually lives somewhere other than ComfyUI's `input` folder. Two things follow from that.

**Browse uploads; pasting does not.** The **Browse…** button copies the file you pick into
ComfyUI's `input` folder and refers to it by name from then on, exactly like the stock image
loaders. Pasting a full path instead leaves the file where it is and reads it in place — which is
what you want for a 4 GB clip you would rather not duplicate.

**Previews of pasted paths are served by this pack.** ComfyUI's own file server only reaches its
`input` folder, so a pasted path needs a route of its own. That route reads any file with a video
extension that ComfyUI itself can read, named by the request. ComfyUI listens on localhost only
unless you have deliberately changed that, so on a normal single-machine setup this is the same
access you already have.

If ComfyUI is reachable from anywhere else — `--listen`, a tunnel, a shared box — set this to
confine those routes to ComfyUI's own folder:

| variable | effect |
|---|---|
| `H3_FACEREFINE_STRICT_PATHS` | Unset (default): paths anywhere are read. Set to any non-empty value: only paths inside ComfyUI's own folder are read; everything else is refused with a message saying so. |

With it set, use **Browse…** to bring a video in rather than pasting a path to it.

Setting it, in the launcher you already use:

```bat
:: run_nvidia_gpu.bat, before the python line
set H3_FACEREFINE_STRICT_PATHS=1
```

```powershell
# PowerShell, for the session
$env:H3_FACEREFINE_STRICT_PATHS = "1"
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export H3_FACEREFINE_STRICT_PATHS=1
```

It is read per request, so it takes effect as soon as ComfyUI restarts with it set.

## Quick start

Two example workflows are included, both annotated in-graph. They differ in **how the subject
is chosen**; everything downstream is identical:

| Template | Which face gets refined | Video loaded by |
|---|---|---|
| **H3 Face Refine Auto Select** | a ranking rule, `largest_face` as shipped | your own video loader |
| **H3 Face Refine Manual Select** | you, in [Pick faces](#pick-faces), one per shot | `H3 Load Video + Face Select` |

Both ship the SAM mask pair present but **muted**, so neither needs a SAM model to run. Unmute the
pair to swap the rect paste mask for a face-shaped one, and drop `feather` to 4-8 when you do.
Impact Pack itself is still needed either way — see [Requirements](#requirements) — because the
templates' detector values use the model-folder naming its subpack registers.

Both are installed as ComfyUI **workflow templates**. Open them from
**Workflow → Browse Templates** once the pack is installed, no file hunting required.
They also live in [`example_workflows/`](example_workflows) if you would rather load the JSON
directly.

### Common to both

1. **Ref image(s)** — the same character references you generated the video with. `Ref 1` is the
   identity; `Ref 2` is optional, for wardrobe or a second look.
2. **Prompt** — the video's own prompt.

That is all either template needs beyond the video. `length` on the H3 node is already wired from
the track node's `frame_count`, so it follows whatever clip you load, and `width`/`height` are wired
from `canvas_w`/`canvas_h` so the crop and the latent cannot disagree.

Audio comes from the source clip. If you have an isolated vocal track for lipsync, unmute the
separate audio loader and wire it in place of the clip's own audio.

### Auto Select — a rule picks the face

Point `VHS_LoadVideoPath` at your video and queue. The tracker detects every face and takes the one
`select` names — `largest_face` as shipped, with `select_index` taking the 2nd, 3rd and so on out of
that ranking. See [Choosing which face](#choosing-which-face) for the full vocabulary.

The subject is chosen **once per shot**, not per frame, and continuity follows that same face from
there. If the clip has hard cuts, set `cut_detection` to `auto (pyscenedetect)` so each shot chooses again — a cut
renumbers everyone, so a rule can otherwise land on a different person after the join.

Use this when one rule describes your subject for the whole clip: they are the biggest face, or the
only face, or reliably centre frame.

### Manual Select — you pick the face

Here `H3 Load Video + Face Select` replaces the video loader and does the detection itself, handing
the tracker its boxes, its cuts and your choice on `face_pick`. The tracker never decodes or detects
the clip a second time.

1. **Point it at your video** — **Browse…** copies a file into ComfyUI's `input`, or paste any
   absolute path, since source footage usually lives elsewhere.
2. **Set `cut_detection` to `auto (pyscenedetect)`** if the clip has hard cuts, so it is split into shots.
3. **Click `Pick faces`.** The dialogue scans once, then shows a frame per shot with every face
   outlined and numbered. Choose your subject in each one and press **Use these** — see
   [Pick faces](#pick-faces).
4. **Queue.**

With `select` on `manual` the node will not run until a pick exists, so an unanswered graph fails
fast and says so rather than silently refining whoever happens to rank first. The other `select`
modes work here too if you would rather it choose: `identity_reference` matches a wired reference
image per shot, and the ranking rules behave exactly as they do on the tracker.

Use this when a rule cannot describe your subject: a crowd, a face that is not the biggest, or a
person who has to be followed across cuts that renumber everyone.

**`H3 Per-Frame Denoise` sits in the model path, not beside it.** It takes `MODEL` in and returns a
patched `MODEL` out, and that output must reach `BasicGuider` and `BasicScheduler`. Route the
unpatched model straight past it and the mask still applies but the held frames come back nearly
clean instead of at the sampler's current sigma — with no error to tell you.

The `transform` output is the spine of the whole thing: it records where every crop came from, so
the stitch can put each refined face back exactly where it belongs.

# Node reference

## H3 Load Video + Face Select

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Load%20Video%20%2B%20Face%20Select.png" alt="H3 Load Video + Face Select" width="380">

Loads a video, finds every face and every hard cut in one pass, and decides which face is the
subject **before the graph runs**. Optional: without it the tracker detects and ranks exactly as it
always has.

It replaces the video loader when used, so it emits the images and the audio as well as the
selection.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `video` | - | The video. **Browse** uploads one into ComfyUI's `input` folder, or paste any path - source footage usually lives elsewhere. Surrounding quotes are stripped, so a path copied from Explorer works as pasted. |
| `detector` | first found | Face detection model. This node owns detection when it is wired in — it detects once and hands the boxes to the tracker. |
| `confidence` | `0.35` | The **detector's** score floor - shown as `detector_confidence`. Lower catches more profiles and small faces, at the cost of false positives. Nothing to do with identity matching; that is `identity_threshold`. |
| `select` | `manual` | How the subject is decided. `manual` means you review the shots and choose; `identity_reference` matches a wired reference image; everything else is a rule that guesses - same vocabulary as the tracker, see [Choosing which face](#choosing-which-face). |
| `select_index` | `0` | Which face in that ranking is the subject. |
| `confirmed_pick` | - | Your reviewed answer while `select` is `manual`: **one face number per shot**, comma separated - `0,3,4`. Written by **Pick faces** and saved with the workflow. It is dropped automatically if you change the video, the detector, the frame range or the cut settings, because those change the shots it describes. |
| `cut_detection` *(opt)* | `none` | `auto (pyscenedetect)` finds hard cuts, so the subject is chosen per shot and the tracker does not smooth across a cut. |
| `cut_threshold` *(opt)* | `3.0` | How far a frame has to stand out from its neighbours to count as a cut. |
| `skip_first_frames` *(opt)* | `0` | Drop this many frames from the start. The audio is cut to match. |
| `frame_load_cap` *(opt)* | `0` | Stop after this many frames. 0 loads everything. |
| `select_every_nth` *(opt)* | `1` | Keep every nth frame. Above 1 the reported `fps` changes with it. |
| `identity_reference` *(opt)* | - | A picture of the person to refine. Each shot picks the face matching it, so the same person is followed across a cut without hand-picking. A frame of the clip works. Setting `select` to `identity_reference` without wiring one is a hard error. Wiring one while `select` is set to anything else is silent — the reference is simply never read. |
| `identity_clip_vision` *(opt)* | - | A `CLIP_VISION` model from a `CLIPVisionLoader`. Only for `identity_model = clip_vision`. |
| `identity_model` *(opt)* | `insightface` | Shown only when `select` is `identity_reference`. `insightface` for photographic faces; `clip_vision` or `ccip` for illustration and anime. See [Anime and other non-photographic material](#anime-and-other-non-photographic-material). |
| `identity_threshold` *(opt)* | `0.28` | Shown only when `select` is `identity_reference`. How close a match has to be to count as the same person. The scale depends on `identity_model` — **set `0` to use whichever default the chosen model recommends.** |
| `X` / `Y` *(opt)* | `0` | Shown only when `select` is `closest_to_xy`. The point to measure from, in pixels of the **source** frame, origin top-left. See [Preview coordinates](#preview-coordinates). |
| `frame_index` *(opt)* | `0` | Shown only when `select` is `closest_to_xy`. The frame the `X`, `Y` measurement is taken on, counting from `0` over the frames this node loaded — that is, after `skip_first_frames`, `frame_load_cap` and `select_every_nth`. |

**Outputs**

| Output | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `images` | `H3 Face Track + Crop` → `images`, and `H3 Face Stitch Back` → `base_images` |
| `audio` | The save node, and `MiniMax H3 Native Audio Lock` if you are driving lipsync |
| `face_pick` | `H3 Face Track + Crop` → `face_pick` |
| `preview` | Optional: one card per shot, every face outlined and numbered. This is how you find out which number to use |
| `report` | Text summary: shots found, and which frame each locked onto |
| `frame_count` | Wire to the H3 node's `length` so it follows the video |
| `fps` | Optional: the effective frame rate after `select_every_nth` |

**The subject is chosen once per shot, not once per video.** A cut renumbers everyone — the biggest
face before it need not be the biggest after — so `confirmed_pick` takes one index per shot. That is
also how you say *"these two differently-numbered faces are the same person"*: the ranking cannot
know that, so you tell it.

> **To see the numbers cheaply**, mute everything downstream of the tracker and queue. Only the
> detection pass runs — seconds, no H3.

### Pick faces

`select = manual` is answered here. **Pick faces** scans the video once, then shows a frame from
every shot with each face outlined and numbered, and writes your answer — one index per shot —
into `confirmed_pick`.

<img src="screenshots/Pick%20Faces%20UI.png" alt="The Pick faces dialogue" width="640">

Under each frame is a chip per detected face, plus **not in this shot**. The green chip is the
current pick, and the numbers on the chips are the numbers drawn on the boxes.

Those numbers run **left to right across the frame**, which is how the picker always numbers,
whatever `select` says. They are not `select_index` positions — in `manual` that widget is hidden
and the node ignores it entirely, because your pick already names the face.

**not in this shot** records `-1` for that shot: the subject genuinely is not present, so those
frames keep their original pixels instead of the tracker settling on somebody else. It is the
hand-picked equivalent of `absent_shots` on the tracker.

<img src="screenshots/Pick%20Faces%20UI%20-%20Multiple%20Faces.png" alt="Choosing between four faces" width="640">

**Across a cut the numbering is not stable.** A cut renumbers everyone, so the person who was face
`1` before it may be face `3` after. That is the whole reason the dialogue asks per shot rather than
once: it is where you say *"these differently-numbered faces are the same person"*, which no
ranking rule can work out for itself. The row along the top keeps your picks side by side so you
can check them against each other.

<img src="screenshots/Pick%20Faces%20UI%20-%20Multiple%20Scenes.png" alt="One pick per shot across three shots" width="640">

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| **Use these** | Writes the picks into `confirmed_pick` and closes |
| **Cancel** | Closes and changes nothing |
| **Clear** | Empties every pick, to start over |

**Neither button will run while a render is going.** Both refuse rather than compete with the
sampler for the GPU. The scan dialogue offers a *Scan anyway* escape if you want it regardless;
**Preview coordinates** has none and simply declines until the queue is clear.

Scanning is cached: reopening the dialogue reports *reused the previous scan* and is immediate. The
scan is redone when the video, the detector, the confidence, the frame range or the cut settings
change, because every one of those changes the shots the picks describe. That cache belongs to the
dialogue alone — when the graph runs, the node detects the clip again for the render itself. What is
saved is the *tracker* repeating it, not the node. For the same reason
`confirmed_pick` is dropped automatically when they change, rather than being left pointing at
faces that have been renumbered underneath it.

Once picked, the button on the node names the choice, so the graph stays readable without
reopening the dialogue:

### Preview coordinates

`select = closest_to_xy` is typed rather than clicked, so the only real question is where the
numbers landed. **Preview coordinates** renders `frame_index` with a crosshair at your `X`, `Y`,
every face outlined, and the nearest one highlighted:

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Load%20Video%20%2B%20Face%20Select%20-%20XY%20Preview.png" alt="The X, Y coordinate preview" width="340">

The caption states what it resolved to — `frame 0 · 2 face(s) · nearest is face 0` — so the
point can be confirmed against the person you meant before anything is rendered.

The point does **not** have to land on a face. The nearest face *centre* wins at any distance, so
putting it roughly where the subject stands is enough. This preview sits on the node rather than in
a dialogue deliberately: the picture belongs beside the fields being edited, and a second dialogue would
read as a second way of choosing a face by hand, which `manual` already is.


## H3 Face Track + Crop

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Face%20Track%20%2B%20Crop.png" alt="H3 Face Track + Crop" width="380">

Detects the face on every frame, fills gaps where detection fails, smooths the trajectory, and
emits a constant-size batch of crops plus the `transform` needed to paste results back.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `images` | - | The video to refine. Connect your video loader. |
| `detector` | first found | Face detection model from `models/ultralytics/`. `face_yolov8m.pt` is a good default. |
| `confidence` | `0.35` | The **detector's** score floor - shown as `detector_confidence`. Lower catches more profiles and small faces, at the cost of false positives. Nothing to do with identity matching; that is `identity_threshold`. |
| `crop_factor` | `2.5` | Crop side as a multiple of face **height**. 2.5 puts the face at ~40% of the crop. Bigger gives more context so the seam lands in hair and background, but less magnification. **2.0-3.0 is the useful range.** |
| `canvas_width` / `canvas_height` | `768` | Resolution H3 generates at. In `manual` these are used **exactly as typed**, high or low. Ignored in the auto modes, which size the canvas from the crop instead. 768 is H3's native short edge; 512 costs 2.25× less in latent tokens. |
| `canvas_mode` | `manual` | `manual` uses the two values above, exactly as typed. `auto_no_downscale` sizes from the largest crop so no frame is ever downscaled. `auto_capped_768` does the same but clamps to 768, a sane VRAM ceiling and the best default. **Both auto modes clamp up to a minimum of 512×512**, whatever the crop: the crop is bounded by the source frame, so without that floor a small face in a low-resolution clip would size the canvas down to the crop and hand H3 the same small face it renders badly. `manual` is never clamped. |
| `smooth_window` | `21` | Frames of smoothing on the crop **centre**. 21 at 24 fps is ~0.9 s. Raise if the box shivers, lower if it lags fast head movement. |
| `size_smooth_window` | `51` | Frames of smoothing on the crop **size**. Deliberately larger than the centre window, because size jitter makes the crop breathe, which changes the resample factor every frame and reads as shimmer. |
| `smooth_method` | `gaussian` | `gaussian` rejects jitter best. `savgol` preserves the shape of a push-in at large windows. `moving_average` is a plain boxcar and leaves residual jitter. |
| `size_mode` | `per_frame` | `per_frame` holds the face at a constant fraction of every crop, which is correct for push-ins. `max_of_clip` uses one size throughout, only useful when the shot is static. |
| `identity_reference` *(opt)* | - | A clear face image of the person to track. Picks the subject by identity rather than size. **Read only while `identity_track` is on** — with it off the reference is never consulted and `select` decides instead, which the report warns about. |
| `identity_track` *(opt)* | `True` | Hold one subject through a crowd. Continuity decides most frames; the identity embedding is consulted only when two candidates are similarly plausible or their boxes overlap. |
| `identity_threshold` *(opt)* | `0.28` | Minimum score to accept a face as the reference person. Below it, the frame falls back to continuity, which is what carries tracking through profiles and occlusion. The scale depends on `identity_model` — **set `0` to use whichever default the chosen model recommends.** |
| `select` *(opt)* | `largest_face` | Which face is the subject. `largest_face`, `smallest_face`, `left_most`, `right_most`, `top_most`, `bottom_most`, `centre_most`, `closest_to_xy`, `detector_score`. See [Choosing which face](#choosing-which-face). |
| `fallback_detector` *(opt)* | `none` | Used only on frames where the face detector finds nothing. A person/body model gives a real head position from the top of the body box, which beats interpolating blindly. With several people in frame it uses the body whose head lands nearest where the subject is expected. |
| `fallback_head_frac` *(opt)* | `0.5` | Head centre as a multiple of face height below the top of the person box. 0.5 suits a head seen from behind. |
| `select_index` *(opt)* | `0` | Which face in that ranking to track. `0` is the first, `1` the second, and so on. |
| `identity_model` *(opt)* | `insightface` | Which model decides two faces are the same person. `insightface` for photographed faces, `clip_vision` or `ccip` for anime and other non-photographic material. See [Anime and other non-photographic material](#anime-and-other-non-photographic-material). |
| `cut_detection` *(opt)* | `none` | `auto (pyscenedetect)` finds hard cuts and treats each shot as its own window for the smoothing, interpolation and composite fade, so the crop is not dragged across a cut. See [Videos with cuts in them](#videos-with-cuts-in-them). |
| `cut_threshold` *(opt)* | `3.0` | How far a frame has to stand out from its neighbours to count as a cut. Only used when `cut_detection` is `auto (pyscenedetect)`. |
| `absent_shots` *(opt)* | `off` | Find shots the subject is not in, so they are never rendered. `by_identity` treats a shot where no sampled face matches the identity anchor above `identity_threshold` as not containing the subject: those frames keep their original pixels and drop out of the batch. Needs identity matching to be working — it does nothing without an anchor. Sampling is not exhaustive, so a brief appearance can be missed; `report` names every shot it drops and the score it saw. |
| `identity_clip_vision` *(opt)* | - | A `CLIP_VISION` model from a `CLIPVisionLoader`, used only when `identity_model` is `clip_vision`. |
| `X` / `Y` *(opt)* | `0` | Shown only when `select` is `closest_to_xy`. The point to measure from, in pixels of the **source** frame, origin top-left. |
| `frame_index` *(opt)* | `0` | Shown only when `select` is `closest_to_xy`. The frame the `X`, `Y` measurement is taken on, counting from `0` over the frames handed to this node. |
| `face_pick` *(opt)* | - | From `H3 Load Video + Face Select`. Carries the detected boxes, the shot boundaries and the chosen subject, so this node does not detect the video a second time. `select`, `select_index`, `cut_detection`, `cut_threshold`, `X`, `Y` and `frame_index` are all greyed out while it is connected. `detector` greys too unless a crop-based `identity_model` still needs it; `confidence` greys unless either that or a `fallback_detector` does. |

**Outputs**

| Output | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `crops` | `H3 Inject Video Latent` → `images`, and `H3 Face Mask (SAM)` → `crops` |
| `transform` | `H3 Face Stitch Back`, `H3 Per-Frame Denoise`, `H3 Face Mask (SAM)` |
| `preview` | Optional: the video with the crop box drawn on every frame, colour-coded by how the subject was placed. See **Reading `preview`** below |
| `report` | Text summary: detections, gaps, frames where the subject was lost, magnification warnings |
| `canvas_w` / `canvas_h` | **Must** be wired to the H3 node's `width` / `height` |
| `frame_count` | The number of frames actually **rendered**, which is fewer than the clip when `absent_shots` drops a shot. Wire to the H3 node's `length` so it follows the video |

> **Reading `preview`.** Every frame carries the crop box, coloured by how the tracker placed it:
>
> | Colour | Meaning |
> |---|---|
> | green | the subject's face was detected on this frame and followed |
> | yellow | no face was detected; the head was placed from the body box found by `fallback_detector` |
> | red | no position for the subject on this frame - the face was not detected, or the subject was lost - so the box is interpolated from the frames either side |
>
> The composite fades out across yellow and red stretches, so those frames keep their original
> pixels. With `select` = `closest_to_xy` and no `face_pick`, an amber crosshair also marks `X`, `Y`.
> Saving `preview` as a video is the quickest way to check a track before spending a render on it.

> **Wire the canvas, don't type it.** In the `auto_*` modes this node chooses the size. If the H3
> node's `width`/`height` disagree, the latent shapes differ and injection refuses.

> Watch `report` for `magnification < 1.0x`. That means the crop is being *downscaled* into the
> canvas and real detail is being discarded. Raise the canvas, or skip videos that are close-up
> throughout since they have nothing to gain.

### Choosing which face

`select` names **which face**, and `select_index` takes the *n*th out of that ranking. They
apply only when no `identity_reference` is connected.

| `select` | picks |
|---|---|
| `largest_face` | the biggest face by **height** — the measurement the tracker uses everywhere else |
| `smallest_face` | the smallest by height, for refining the distant person rather than the near one |
| `left_most` / `right_most` | furthest left / right, by the **centre** of the face box |
| `top_most` / `bottom_most` | highest / lowest in frame, by the centre of the box |
| `centre_most` | nearest the centre of the frame |
| `closest_to_xy` | nearest the `X`, `Y` you give, measured on `frame_index` |
| `detector_score` | the detection the detector is most confident about |
| `identity_reference` | the face matching a reference image — `H3 Load Video + Face Select` only |
| `manual` | the face you chose in the picker — `H3 Load Video + Face Select` only |

Direction lives in the name, so there is no separate order widget: `left_most` and `right_most`
are two modes rather than one metric read forwards and backwards.

`closest_to_xy` takes three values of its own, shown only when it is selected. `X` and `Y` are
**pixels of the source frame** measured from the **top-left corner** — X increasing to the right,
Y increasing downward — so on a 960×544 clip (0, 0) is the top-left, (960, 544) the bottom-right,
and (480, 272) the middle. The point does not have to land on a face: the nearest face centre wins
at any distance. `frame_index` is the frame the measurement is taken on, counting from `0`, over
the frames the node loaded — so with `skip_first_frames` set it counts from the first frame kept.

`select_index` then picks out of that ranking: `0` is the first, `1` the second. To see which
number is who, put an **`H3 Load Video + Face Select`** in front of the tracker and connect its
`preview` to a `PreviewImage` — it emits **one card per shot**, every detected face outlined and
numbered, the chosen one highlighted in green.

The numbering on those cards follows **that node's own `select`**, and while it sits at its default
`manual` the cards are numbered left to right across the frame. So a number read off the preview
only lines up with the tracker's `select_index` when both nodes are set to the same ranking.

Three things worth knowing:

- **A rank is a per-frame property, not an identity.** The pick is made **once**, on the first frame
  that actually contains the requested index, and continuity carries the subject from there. Ranking
  every frame independently would hop between people the moment two of them cross or change size.
  The report prints the frame it locked on at.
- **Anything before that frame is interpolated.** If you ask for index 2 and the video opens on a
  single face, those opening frames have no index 2 to lock onto, so they are filled in from the
  lock-on frame and faded out of the composite, exactly like a detection dropout. The report counts
  them, and warns if there are more than a dozen.
- **The identity anchor follows your pick.** With no reference image the node normally assumes the
  biggest face is the subject — which used to override `centre_most` in a crowd. Now, once you
  select a different subject, the anchor is rebuilt from *your* pick, so identity matching holds
  that person rather than dragging the crop back onto the dominant face.

**Which mechanism decides.** Three things can answer "who is the subject", and they have a
fixed order:

1. **A reviewed pick** - `select` = `manual` on `H3 Load Video + Face Select`, carried on
   `face_pick`. You chose the face for each shot, so nothing overrides it.
2. **A connected `identity_reference`** - decides on its own, and `select` / `select_index` are
   ignored. The report says so.
3. **The ranking rule** - `select`, `select_index`.

Whichever wins only decides *where each shot starts*. From there the subject is held by
continuity - the nearest box to where they were, penalised for size change - and the identity
embedding is consulted only when two candidates are equally plausible or their boxes overlap.
On a typical video that is a couple of frames out of hundreds, and the report counts them.

**When the subject is lost.** In a shot with more than one face, continuity only carries the subject
onto a face within about three quarters of their own face height of where they just were, a little
more after a gap. When their face stops being detected and no face is within that reach, those
frames are left unresolved rather than handed to whoever is nearest: the crop is interpolated across
them, `preview` draws them red, the composite fades out so they keep their original pixels, and the
report lists them on its `lost:` line. The subject is picked up again when a face reappears within
reach of where they were lost. A subject who moves further than that while their face is hidden -
walking behind someone and out the other side - is not followed to the new position.

So a reference and a reviewed pick are not in conflict: the pick chooses the person, and the
reference still anchors the tie-breaking.

**If the automatic choice grabs the wrong person,** set `select` to `manual` and pick the face
yourself. That is what it is for. Lock-on deliberately accepts the best available match at any
score, so that small, poorly detailed faces - exactly the ones worth refining - are not
rejected for embedding weakly; the cost is that it can occasionally settle on the wrong face.

If the video never shows as many faces at once as you asked for, `select_index` is clamped to what
exists and the report says so.

### Videos with cuts in them

The crop trajectory is smoothed over the whole video. Across a hard cut the smoothing kernel spans
two shots and drags the box toward where the subject stood in the other one, for about half a
smoothing window either side. A dropout spanning the cut is worse: it is filled along a line that
existed in neither shot.

Set `cut_detection` to `auto (pyscenedetect)` and each shot becomes its own window for the smoothing, the gap
interpolation and the composite fade. Continuity also re-locks at each cut, since "nearest box to
where the subject was" means nothing once the camera has changed shot.

Three things worth knowing:

- **The canvas is still sized once for the whole video.** H3 generates one width/height for the
  batch, so a video mixing a wide shot with a close-up still sizes off the close-up. `max_of_clip`
  stays video-wide for the same reason.
- **A shot shorter than the smoothing window gets less smoothing**, not none — the window is clamped
  to the frames available. The crop can shiver on brief shots. The report names the shortest shot
  and warns when it is under the window.
- **A false cut costs smoothing on both sides of it.** The report says how many shots were found, so
  check it against what you know is in the video before trusting the result. Raise `cut_threshold` if
  it splits a continuous shot; lower it if it misses a cut between similar frames.

`H3 Per-Frame Denoise` splits its strength curve at the same boundaries, using the shot boundaries
the tracker publishes on `transform`.


### Anime and other non-photographic material

`buffalo_l` is ArcFace trained on photographed faces, and the node reaches it through InsightFace's
**own** detector (SCRFD, trained on WIDER FACE). On illustration that detector may struggle to match, so
there are no candidates to compare and identity matching quietly degrades to continuity. Nothing
goes visibly wrong — you simply never get the crowd handling.

Swapping only the recogniser would not fix that, because the candidates still have to come from
SCRFD. So the two other backends embed **the boxes your own detector already found**:

| `identity_model` | needs | good for |
|---|---|---|
| `insightface` *(default)* | nothing extra | photographed human faces. Unchanged. |
| `clip_vision` | a `CLIPVisionLoader` wired to `identity_clip_vision` | any domain — anime, 3D, stylised. No install. |
| `ccip` | `pip install dghs-imgutils` | anime specifically. Purpose-built for *"is this the same character?"* |

`ccip` is [CCIP](https://github.com/deepghs/imgutils), the illustration counterpart of ArcFace, and
it is the most accurate of the three on anime. It is **deliberately not a declared dependency** of
this pack: it pins `numpy<2` and pulls `opencv-contrib-python`, which shadows the OpenCV build
ComfyUI ships in exactly the way `onnxruntime-gpu` shadows `onnxruntime`. Install it yourself if you
want it; nothing else changes if you do not. Its ONNX models download on first use.

`clip_vision` needs no install, works on anything, and reuses a model you probably already have for
IPAdapter or Redux. It describes *appearance* rather than identity, so two characters with a similar
palette can collide, and its similarities sit high and close together.

**Also swap the detector.** These backends only see what `detector` gives them, so pair them with an
anime face model in `models/ultralytics/bbox/` — the usual choices are
[deepghs/anime_face_detection](https://huggingface.co/deepghs/anime_face_detection) or Anzhc's
face-seg models. A photographic `face_yolov8m.pt` may not find anime faces either.

**Setting the threshold.** `identity_threshold` means a different thing per backend: `0.28` suits
InsightFace cosine, `clip_vision` wants roughly `0.80`, and `ccip` scores `0.5` at its own published
operating point. **Set it to `0` to use the chosen model's own default.** The report prints the
scores it actually saw, and warns when the threshold cleared every candidate and so filtered
nothing — set it from that evidence rather than guessing.

**Multiple people:** run the pipeline once per subject, each with that person's `identity_reference`
and their own refs on the H3 node, then chain them, feeding run 1's stitched output in as run 2's
`base_images`. The composites accumulate.

## H3 Inject Video Latent (img2img)

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Inject%20Video%20Latent%20(img2img).png" alt="H3 Inject Video Latent (img2img)" width="380">

Encodes real frames into the **video** stream of H3's joint audio-video latent, leaving the audio
stream intact. This is the missing img2img path: H3's stock nodes always build a zeros latent, because
references are conditioning re-injected each step, never a starting point. Without this there
is no video-to-video.

**Inputs**

| Input | What to connect |
|---|---|
| `av_latent` | The `LATENT` output of `MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo` |
| `images` | `crops` from **H3 Face Track + Crop** |
| `vae` | The **video** VAE |

**Outputs:** `av_latent` (onwards to `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock`) and `report`.

It has no widgets. Strength is set downstream by `BasicScheduler`'s `denoise`, **not** by
`SplitSigmas`. See [Denoise](#denoise) below.

---

## H3 Per-Frame Denoise

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Per-Frame%20Denoise.png" alt="H3 Per-Frame Denoise" width="380">

Varies denoise strength along the temporal axis via the latent's noise mask, so one sampling pass
covers a shot that goes from distant to close.

A single denoise cannot serve a whole video: a tiny face has no detail to preserve and wants a
strong pass so the model *synthesizes*, while a large face has real detail and wants a gentle pass
so it is not rewritten. This node scales the base denoise per frame by measured face size.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | - | The H3 model on its way to the sampler, from `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock`. **Required.** Making a per-frame mask behave takes two changes to the MODEL rather than to the latent: this node's video mask is kept out of H3's per-token timesteps, and the frames that mask holds back are re-noised to the step the sampler is on instead of being handed back nearly clean. |
| `av_latent` | - | From `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock` |
| `transform` | - | From **H3 Face Track + Crop**. This is where face sizes come from |
| `denoise_multiplier_small_face` | `1.0` | **Multiplier** on the denoise set on `BasicScheduler`, applied where the face is smallest. Not a denoise value in itself. Below `1.0` no frame in the video receives the full denoise you set, which makes the whole video gentler. |
| `denoise_multiplier_large_face` | `0.35` | **Multiplier** on the same value, applied where the face is largest. Lower preserves the real detail those frames already have, since a big face needs less rebuilding than a distant one. |
| `scale_mode` | `absolute_px` | `absolute_px` keys off real face size in source pixels, which is safe across a batch, since a video that never has a small face just sits at the baseline. `relative_to_clip` normalizes to that video's own min/max, so its smallest face always gets the full boost. Use the latter when tuning one video to its extremes. |
| `face_px_small` | `30.0` | Face height (source px) at or below which full `denoise_multiplier_small_face` applies. |
| `face_px_large` | `120.0` | Face height (source px) at or above which `denoise_multiplier_large_face` applies. |
| `gamma` | `1.0` | Curve on the interpolation. `>1` keeps strength high until the face is genuinely large; `<1` drops it off early. |
| `smooth_frames` | `9` | Smooths the strength curve over time. An abrupt denoise change between neighbouring frames shows up as a texture pop, so be generous. |

**Granularity is one latent frame, not one pixel frame.** H3 packs 17 pixel frames into 5 latents, so the finest step the ramp can take is ~3.4 frames. Values are averaged within each latent frame.

**Outputs**

| Output | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `av_latent` | `SamplerCustomAdvanced` → `latent_image` |
| `report` | Text summary of the strength curve |
| `model` | **`BasicGuider` → `model`.** The patched model. Wiring the unpatched model straight from `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock` to the guider costs you both changes above, without any error: the mask still applies, but the held frames come back nearly clean rather than at the sampler's current sigma. |

Base denoise and these multipliers are tuned **together**. The example workflows ship a base of
`0.40` which this node scales down on large-face frames. If you bypass this node, drop the base a
long way or every large face gets rewritten.

---

### Denoise

Denoise values do **not** transfer from SDXL-family models. H3 is flow matching with a large sigma
shift:

```
sigma = shift * t / (1 + (shift - 1) * t)
```

At the default shift of 12, `0.25`, an ordinary FaceDetailer value, lands at an effective sigma
of **0.800** and rewrites the frame.

| denoise | effective sigma (shift 12) |
|---|---|
| 0.02 | 0.197 |
| 0.05 | 0.387 |
| 0.15 | ~0.68 |
| 0.25 | 0.800 |

`steps` and `denoise` are **independent**: `BasicScheduler` builds a `steps/denoise`-long
full-range schedule and keeps the lowest `steps+1` sigmas, so 4 steps with a turbo LoRA is both
fast and gentle. Do **not** use `SplitSigmas`. On a 4-step schedule at shift 12 even the last
split point is already sigma 0.800.

Push the ceiling too high and the head drifts relative to the body, a content problem no mask can
hide.

## H3 Face Mask (SAM)

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Face%20Mask%20(SAM).png" alt="H3 Face Mask (SAM)" width="380">

Produces true face-shaped paste masks instead of a rectangle, temporally smoothed. Optional, and
requires Impact Pack for `SAMLoader`.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `crops` | - | **The tracker's `crops`, not the decoded result.** See the warning below. |
| `sam_model` | - | From Impact Pack's `SAMLoader` |
| `transform` | - | From **H3 Face Track + Crop** |
| `threshold` | `0.93` | SAM confidence threshold for accepting mask pixels. |
| `dilation` | `0` | Grow the mask. SAM masks are accurate, so they rarely need it. |
| `temporal_smooth` | `5` | Frames of averaging across the mask stack. `1` disables it, and the mask edge will shimmer. |

**Outputs:** `masks` (to `H3 Face Stitch Back` → `masks`) and `report`.

> **Mask the input, never the output.** Wire the tracker's crops here. This matches FaceDetailer,
> which computes its mask from the source image; generation never feeds back into the mask. Mask
> the *generated* result instead and, if the model nudges the face inward, the mask traces the new
> smaller silhouette while the original face pokes out past it, most visibly the nose on profile
> shots. It is also cheaper: no dependency on the sampler, so SAM need not be resident alongside
> the video model.

**Is it worth it?** Often not. A rect mask frequently beats SAM here. SAM traces the face tightly,
so any drift in the refined face lands right on the silhouette, whereas a slightly looser rect puts
the seam in hair and background where it reads far less. Try the rect workflow first.

> If you use SAM masks, drop `feather` on the stitch node to **4-8**. A rect needs far more.

---

## H3 Face Stitch Back

Warps each refined crop back onto the exact float box it came from, colour-matches it, feathers the
edge and composites. A single batched `grid_sample` does the warp, so a trajectory smoothed to
sub-pixel precision is not re-quantized on the way home.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `base_images` | - | The **original** frames, the same video fed to the tracker |
| `refined_crops` | - | `VAEDecode` output |
| `transform` | - | From **H3 Face Track + Crop** |
| `paste_region` | `face_only` | What actually composites. `face_only` / `face_ellipse` paste just the detected face box; `full_crop` pastes hair, shoulders and background too and risks a visible rectangle. |
| `mask_dilation` | `16` | Grow the face box before blurring, in canvas px, so the blur has room and the blend does not eat into the face. |
| `feather` | `6` | Gaussian blur radius on the paste mask, in **source pixels**, measured against the final frame, so the blend is the same physical width at any magnification. Use ~24 with a rect mask, 4-8 with SAM. |
| `colour_match` | `1.0` | Match the crop's per-channel mean/std to the region it replaces. The crop and the frame went through independent passes, so without this the face can come back subtly brighter and read as pasted on. |
| `blend` | `1.0` | Global opacity of the refined face. Below 1.0 mixes back toward the original, useful to dial back over-sharpening. |
| `undetected_frames` | `fade_out` | What to do where no face was found. **All** frames still go through H3 either way, which is what keeps it temporally consistent. This only controls pasting. `fade_out` ramps the composite to zero across the gap; `skip` hard-cuts to original pixels; `composite_anyway` risks H3 hallucinating a face onto the back of a head. |
| `feather_scales_with_crop` *(opt)* | `False` | Legacy: treat `feather` as canvas pixels so the blend narrows as the crop shrinks. Leave off. |
| `masks` *(opt)* | - | Per-frame masks from **H3 Face Mask (SAM)**. Overrides `paste_region`. |

**Outputs:** `images`, the finished frames. Send to your video save node.

> **Only the face region composites.** The wide crop exists to give the sampler *context*. It is
> not what gets pasted. Pasting the whole crop covers roughly 88% of the canvas versus 16% for the
> face box, and any change the model made to hair or background returns as a rectangle.

## H3 Face Transform Info

<img src="screenshots/H3%20Face%20Transform%20Info.png" alt="H3 Face Transform Info" width="380">

A debug node. Prints the per-frame boxes so you can sanity-check tracking before spending time on a
sampling pass.

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `transform` | - | From **H3 Face Track + Crop** |
| `max_rows` | `12` | How many frames to print. |

**Outputs:** `info` (a string). It is an output node, so it displays in the graph directly.

Use it when the stitch looks misaligned, or to confirm gap-filling behaved on a video where the
subject turns away.

## Lipsync

H3 is a **joint** audio-video model. `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock` encodes real audio into the audio
stream of the AV latent, sets `noise_mask` to ones for video and zeros for audio so only video
denoises, and the video branch cross-attends to that fixed audio. That is what shapes the mouth.

Feed it an isolated **vocals** track for a cleaner signal. The **original** audio goes separately
into the save node. Two distinct audio paths, easy to confuse.

---

## Gotchas

- **Frame count is snapped up to H3's 17k+5 grid** (5, 22, 39 … 175, 226, 362). Videos generated by
  H3 already sit on it. Anything else is rounded up: the extra frames are padded with reference
  content, refined, then discarded on stitch. Both the select and track nodes say so in their report
  and name the nearest grid value below. It costs sampling time and nothing else, but `frame_load_cap`
  will trim to a grid value if you would rather not pay it.
- **Cost is `canvas² × frames`.** Auto canvas sizing considers face size only, so on a long video it
  can pick a canvas that exceeds VRAM and falls back to streaming weights from system RAM, an
  order-of-magnitude slowdown rather than a clean error.
- **`SAMLoader`'s `AUTO` device mode leaves the model on CPU** until `prepare_device()` is called.
  This pack calls it; if you write your own SAM path, missing it makes mask passes 10-50× slower
  with the GPU idle at half power.

## Credits

The compositing approach is taken directly from
**[ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)** by
**[ltdrdata](https://github.com/ltdrdata)**, specifically `FaceDetailer` and its detailer paste.
The dilate-then-blur face-region mask, the crop-for-context-but-paste-only-the-face principle, and
the bbox+SAM masking path are all its design; this pack adapts them to a per-frame video pipeline.
If you find this useful, that project is why.

The lipsync path in the example workflows depends on `MiniMaxH3NativeAudioLock`, from
**[MiniMax-H3-NativeAudio-MusicVideo-Workflow](https://github.com/Shrek3OnVH5/MiniMax-H3-NativeAudio-MusicVideo-Workflow)**
by **[Shrek3OnVH5](https://github.com/Shrek3OnVH5)**. It is not redistributed here, so install it
